# Stride For Success
Hey ðŸ‘‹, welcome to the Stride for Success Github. We are a nonprofit devoted to providing grants to low-income runners. Here's some more about us:

## Us
The Stride for Success Foundation was established in 2024 by a passionate group of high school runners and a pole vaulter who envisioned a more inclusive running community. While running may seem like a low-cost sport, competing at a high level requires significant financial resources. Unlike many other sports, securing sponsorships in running can be challenging, particularly for those who lack the time or resources to build a social media presence or participate in major events.

We aim to change this narrative. Our mission is to ensure that every runner has the opportunity to achieve their full potential, regardless of their financial circumstances. We believe in the transformative power of running and are dedicated to making the sport accessible to all. Our success is driven by our dedicated team and supporters like you, who share our vision of a more equitable running world.
